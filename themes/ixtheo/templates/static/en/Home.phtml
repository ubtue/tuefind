                            With the platform "IxTheo Open Journals" we provide a hosting environment for publishers to develop their own open access theological academic journals or series.<br/>
                            You have the opportunity not only to start up a new open access journal, but also to transform a printed journal into an electronic open access publication. We provide you with the publication management software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which can be used to run the entire editorial process right through to publication.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Briefly outlined, cooperation with "IxTheo Open Journals" offers the following advantages:
                            <ul>
                                <li>the FID Theology / Tübingen University Library provides the OJS software free of charge, sets up your journal or series, provides initial training and ongoing technical support</li>
                                <li>with OJS, every editorial step from the submission of essays and the peer review process right up to publication can be implemented with one system</li>
                                <li>the layout and design of an OJS journal / series can be individually arranged</li>
                                <li>all journal articles are assigned a persistent identifier (DOI), which guarantees permanent searchability</li>
                                <li>all journal articles are indexed in IxTheo</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>IxTheo - Find Topic</h3>
                        <p>When you select this option, it opens an additional search field in which you may enter your search term. This term is then used as the starting point of the browsing.</p>
                        <p>1st example: enter the term “God”. You will then see a list of subject heading strings which contain the word “God”.</p>
                        <p>2nd example: enter the terms “God” and “Bible”. You will then see a list of subject heading strings which contain the words “God” and “Bible”.</p>
                        <p>If you change the language of the website to German, the terms are shown in German if they are found in the language concordance.</p>

                        <h3>Browse the Catalogue</h3>
                        <p>The standard browsing function of the software used by IxTheo (VuFind) makes it possible to browse through various fields: DDC-Classification,
                            IxTheo-Classification, Topic (subject heading), Author and Publisher. In a further step, you may determine the items you wish to browse by using other fields.</p>
                        <p>For example, select “Author”, then “By IxTheo-Classification”, then “HB Old Testament”. You will then see a list of authors who have worked in the field
                            of Old Testament research, sorted according to the number of their works catalogued in the IxTheo.</p>

                        <h3>Browse Alphabetically</h3>
                        <p>With this search option, you can decide at which point in the alphabet you would like to start the search. After you’ve selected the
                            browsing category (you may select among Topic, Author, Title or DDC-Classification), enter the letter at which you would like to start to browse.</p>
                        <p>1st example: select “By Author” and enter “Z” next to “starting from”. You will then get a list of all authors whose name starts with the letter “Z”.</p>
                        <p>2nd example: select “By Title” and enter “Tr” next to “starting from”. You will then get a list of all the titles which start with the letter “Tr”.</p>

                    <p>Many useful functions are at your disposal when you create a personal account. Once you’ve registered, you may log into your account by clicking
                        on the link called “Login” on the top right corner.</p>
                    <p>By clicking on “Your account”, you come into your personalized area. You may then use the following functions:</p>

                        <h3>Alerting function</h3>
                        <p>The alerting function lets you know when new articles from certain journals and new volumes from certain series are available. You may decide in which
                            cases you would like to get a corresponding message.</p>
                        <p>In order to receive such “alerts” for a journal or a series, you must mark the corresponding entry for the journal or series as a whole. You can do this
                            by clicking on the “Bell” symbol which you will find on the right side of the corresponding entry. You can manage the list of publications marked for an
                            alert in your account under the heading “New Issue Alerting”.</p>

                        <p>1st example: in order to get alerts for the Theologische Quartalschrift, search for the title of this journal or enter the abbreviation “ThQ”
                            in the search field. Then select under “Format” the “Journal” facet. You will get two entries as a result: one for the printed, and one for the
                            online version of the journal. In this case, it would be preferable to mark both media types for an alert.</p>

                        <p>2nd example: in order to get alerts for the series “Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament”, search for the title of the series or
                            enter the abbreviation “WUNT” in the search field. You will then get a list of entries. Mark the series by clicking on the “Bell” symbol.</p>

                        <p>We will try to make the selection of journals and series for the alerting function more user-friendly in the future. We plan to offer the possibility
                            of marking whole blocks of journals which are catalogued in the IxTheo according to their academic discipline.</p>

                        <h3>Saving search requests</h3>
                        <p>Your current search requests are temporarily stored in the search history. If you would like to have permanent access to certain search requests,
                            you can save them permanently in your account. You may then use them again through a simple mouse click. This feature might be useful for complex
                            requests or for subjects in which you have a continuing interest. In this way, you will find the latest literature on a given subject or area of knowledge.</p>

                        <h3>Saving favorites</h3>
                        <p>You can save interesting titles directly in your account  by clicking on the “Asterisk” symbol which you will find on the right side of the corresponding entry.
                            They are then permanently accessible, and you don’t have to waste any time searching for them again.
                            In order to sort such “favorites”, they are kept in lists which you define yourself. In this way, you can assign interesting titles to specific research
                            projects or subjects.</p>
                        <p>In your account, you can also export your favorites, send them per e-mail or print them.</p>

                    <p>The search for Bible passages has been newly designed in order to cater for the needs of academic users. In order to activate it, you must
                        select the search category “Bible passages” on the right side of the search field. The list of entries must be sorted according to their relevance.</p>

                        <p>The Bible passages may be entered using the internationally recognized names or well-known abbreviations. Abbreviations from other
                            languages (German, French, Italian and Spanish) are also allowed as well as the names used in the Nestle-Aland edition of the
                            New Testament and the Vulgate. In a few cases, there are ambiguities due to accidental similarities in the way some Bible book
                            names are abbreviated in different languages. For example, the abbreviation “es” is used for Isaiah in French, but for Exodus in
                            Italian. In such cases, it is necessary to decide which abbreviations are allowed in order to avoid a conflict. You can access the
                            list of abbreviations allowed <a href="<?='https://' . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . '/docs/Bible_abbreviation.pdf'?>" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a></p>
                        <p>Enter the passage you are looking for in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>Abbreviation of the Bible book chapter,verses</p>
                        <b>Examples:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jn 5,1-20 or Joh 5,1-20</li>
                            <li>1 Cor 10 or 1 Co 10</li>
                            <li>Rom 14,1-15,13 or Rm 14,1-15,13</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The entries found are sorted according to the extent to which they match the search request:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>Exact match: the entry found is identical with the passage entered.</p>
                                <p>For example, the search for Mk 5,25-34 results in a list of entries dealing with Mk 5,25-34.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Match including the passage specified: the entry found includes the passage entered.</p>
                                <p>For example, the search for Mk 5,25-34 also finds entries dealing with Mk 5,24-34.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Indirect match: the entry found is the chapter in which the passage lies.</p>
                                <p>For example, the search for Mk 5,25-34 also finds entries dealing with Mk 5 as a whole.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This search also finds all titles which are linked with the authority record “Blutflüssige Frau” (“bleeding woman” in German),
                            because the synoptic passages Mk 5,25-34, Mt 9,20-22 and Lk 8,43-48 are linked with this authority record.</p>
                        <p>Warning: since some titles are not linked yet with the authority records of the Bible passages, it may be worthwhile to
                            search for a given passage using the search category “All Fields”. However, the advantages of using the specific Bible passage search
                            function are then not available.</p>
                        <p>Technically speaking, the string you enter in the Bible passage search function gets translated into a 8-digit code, with which some
                            computations are possible. The first two digits specify the Bible book, the three middle digits concern the chapter, and the final three
                            contain the verse. For example, Mk 5,25-34 gets translated to the following: 02005025_02005034. In order to determine how close the
                            entries found are to the requested passage, a scoring value is then computed. More information on this topic may be found
