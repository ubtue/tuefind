            <p>The following information was verified carefully, but it does not constitute binding legal advice. We do not assume any liability for possible errors.</p>

                <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col1">

                    <p>Unfortunately, the legal situation with regards to republication is not completely clear. Different national laws may apply depending on the country of the publishing house. Furthermore, many publishing houses describe their policies and rules with regards to republication on their respective websites. You can often find these policies under headings such as “Self-Archiving” or “Open Access”. Such policies may also be found on the platform <a target="_blank" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa Romeo</a>.We would advise you to examine the legal situation carefully and, in case of doubt, to ask permission from the publishing house for a republication. </p>
                    <p>For works or articles published by a German publishing house, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__38.html">§38</a> of the German copyright law applies. The republication of articles from journals, anthologies and dictionaries or encyclopedias is basically allowed, but it may depend on individual agreements reached with the publisher. Monographs may not be republished unless there is an agreement to this effect (e.g. in the case of a dissertation which is out of print) with the publishing house.</p>

                <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col2">

                    <p>When a text is published for the first time, you often have a contract with the corresponding publishing house in which the right to use this publication is defined. This right determines the extent to which you may republish this work, provided it complies with the legal restrictions in place.</p>
                    <p>In order to simplify this process, many publishing houses have adopted policies with specific rules for republication. You can find these policies on their websites under headings such as “Republication”, “Self-Archiving” or “Open Access”. If your publishing house has not made public any policy with regards to republication, you should ask them directly about their policy. Such policies can also be found through the platform <a target="_blank" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa Romeo</a>.</p>

                    <p>When you republish a publication through <?=$currentSystem;?>, it gets stored in a repository managed by the University of Tübingen. The repository for <?=$currentSystem;?> constitutes a non-commercial subject repository. Depending on the policy of the publishing house involved in the first publication, it is possible to republish an article on one’s own personal website, on a repository belonging to one’s own institution or on a non-commercial subject repository. Commercial services such as Academia or ResearchGate are often excluded.</p>
                    <p>If you are not allowed to republish your work on a non-commercial subject repository, you may be allowed to republish it in the repository of your own institution. In this case, please consult the person responsible for Open Access publications at your university library. We would appreciate it very much if you could let us know which of your publications were republished in your institutional repository so that we may include a reference to them in <?=$currentSystem;?>.</p>
