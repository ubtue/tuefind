<h2>Albert Krebs Library</h2>

<p>The Albert Krebs Library in Wiesbaden is a collection of historical and contemporary literature on the subject of the penal system. It is maintained by the Förderkreis für Strafvollzugsforschung und Straffälligenhilfe e.V. (Association for the Promotion of Prison Research and Aid to Offenders), which has set itself the task of promoting science and practice in the field of the penal system and aid for offenders. The library was named after Prof. Dr. Albert Krebs (*1897, †1992), who was committed to reforming the penal system and from whose estate it originated. Over the years, the collection was expanded by the estate of Dr. Heinz Szkibik, which included literature on the GDR state, law and society in addition to literature on the penal system. Moreover, there were also book donations from other sources. Therefore, the Albert Krebs Library also includes literature on related disciplines such as pedagogy and social work. Until now, the holdings of the Albert-Krebs Library were searchable exclusively via a separate database. Due to a cooperation project of the FID Criminology and the Criminological Centre Wiesbaden (KrimZ), it is now also searchable in KrimDok.</p>
