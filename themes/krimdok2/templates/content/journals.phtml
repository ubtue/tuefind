<h1>Journals</h1>

<p>KrimDok contains about 4.700 references to German and foreign language criminological journals, which are available in either print, electronic, hybrid or (totally or partially) retro-digitalized format. Most of the references are of journals, which now changed their titles to a new name or stopped publishing new issues completely.</p>
<p>To facilitate access to open-access documents relevant to criminological research, field specific and non-licensed journals are summarized in a list. Further information to current journals is available in the following lists:</p>
