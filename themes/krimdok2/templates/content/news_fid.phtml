    <li><b><u>12.01.2021</u></b>: Last year, the Specialised Information Service for Criminology submitted a renewal proposal for the funding period 2021 to 2023, which was approved in full by the DFG. This will not only enable the FID Criminology to continue its current activities, such as the acquisition of highly specialised domestic and foreign literature and the maintenance of the freely accessible literature reference database <a target="_blank" href="https://krimdok.uni-tuebingen.de/">KrimDok</a>, but also to implement new projects. In future, for example, there will be a secondary publication service that supports criminological researchers in transferring their articles into open-access publications in compliance with copyright law. The expansion of open access plays an important role overall. In the 2021-23 project period, research data will also be systematically catalogued in KrimDok.</li>
    <li><b><u>13.05.2020</u></b>: The application for another, this time three-year funding period (2021-23) has been submitted to the DFG. We hope to receive full funding in order to expand the information and services offered and thus be able to offer a contemporary service.</li>
    <li><b><u>21.04.2020</u></b>: The FID Criminology would like to thank all participants in the survey on a possible secondary publication service in the 2021-23 funding period. Your feedback is very valuable for our further planning and for a well-founded cost calculation in the application process.</li>
    <li><b><u>09.04.2020</u></b>: <a target="_blank" href="/krimdok_docs/Journals.pdf">The list of journals currently evaluated for KrimDok</a> has been updated. In addition, there is now also an overview of which criminologically relevant journals have a national licence. Both lists and the overview of criminologically relevant open-access journals can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="/Content/krimdok#content">KrimDok details panel</a> under <a target="_blank" href="/Content/krimdok?expand#contributions">Journals and publication series</a>.</li>
    <li><b><u>01.02.2020</u></b>: It is now possible to create <a target="_blank" href="/MyResearch/UserLogin">user accounts</a> on KrimDok.

    <li><b><u>01.01.2020</u></b>: The application for continued funding of the FID Criminology (FID) in 2020 was approved. An application for renewed funding, now for another three years, is already in preparation.</li>

    <li><b><u>17.05.2019</u></b>: The continuation proposal for funding the FID Criminology in 2020 has been submitted to the DFG. Due to internal DFG discussions about a change in the framework conditions since the evaluation of the FIDs, this time only a one-year funding proposal could be submitted according to the previous guidelines. We continue to welcome information requests and ideas for the organisation of the FID Criminology (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de">fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de</a>).</li>
    <li><b><u>17.12.2018</u></b>: The KrimDok homepage has been given a new look. You can now find information about the database and the FID Criminology as well as other announcements from the department, centrally on the newly designed portal page.</li>
