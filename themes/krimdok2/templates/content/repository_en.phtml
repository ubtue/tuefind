<h1>Repository</h1>
<p>
The <a href="https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/56358">criminological repository</a> of the FID Criminology contains a collection of online publications from the field of so-called "grey literature" which are very important for criminological research but are unfortunately scattered across the internet and often difficult to access. These include reports from various ministries, research institutions and other institutions as well as crime statistics from various regions, evaluations from the field of practice and policy, and the like. The collection is compiled in cooperation with partner organisations. All documents are also listed in KrimDok and can be searched there using various search parameters. The open text service for works that have already been published by a publisher enables the green road of open access in the repository. To ensure that the data can be permanently cited and referenced, unique persistent identifiers (DOI, URN, Handle) are assigned. The content is indexed in catalogues and search engines both via these and via corresponding interfaces. For researchers, the advantage of assigning a persistent identifier is that electronic documents in so-called "grey literature" can be retrieved over the long term via a unique internet address. If you or your institution have such documents and they have not yet been included in our repository, we would be pleased to receive information at <a href="mailto:fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de">fidkrim@ifk.uni-tuebingen.de</a>
