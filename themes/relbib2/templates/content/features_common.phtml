<p>Without a personal login you can see / use the following features in RelBib:</p>

<div class="tf-panel-collapse">
    <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#availability">
        <div class="tf-panel-collapse-heading">
            Availability checking
        </div>
    </a>
    <div id="availability" class="collapse tf-panel-collapse-body">
        <p>A special highlight for users of RelBib is the checking of availablity of a title found during a search.</p>
        <p>Click the link <b>HBZ Gateway</b> in the detailed view in order to find out about whether a book or journal is available at your university library.<br/>
           The link leads you to the website of the gateway where it is possible to choose a library location.<br/>
           If you are using a campus network of a registered library, you will be automatically assigned to this library location. Once you have clicked on the chosen library location the availability of the searched title is displayed.<br/>
           If your (university) library is not selectable it means, that it is not yet registered for the gateway. You can make a request to your library yourself or we will do it for you if you write to us. The process of registration is uncomplicated and free of charge for libraries running a link resolver. A more <a href="https://openurlgw.hbz-nrw.de/about" target="_blank">detailed description</a> can be found on the website of the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum (HBZ) des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen. This service can be used worldwide.</p>
        <p>The display <b>Journals Online &amp; Print</b> (JOP) offers the same service for articles and periodicals. The JOP icons show you at one glance whether a periodical is available in your own university. This service only applies to libraries in Germany and Austria.</p>
        <p>In both cases, the availability of the title you are looking for is by default displayed at your library location. HBZ Gateway also allows you to manually set other library locations.</p>

        </div>
    </a>
    <div id="subito" class="collapse tf-panel-collapse-body">
        <p>Instead of the inter-library loan you can order a title to be delivered directly to you via <a href="https://www.subito-doc.de/" target="_blank">Subito</a>, a service liable to costs. The link on your search result display gets you to the website of this delivery service.</p>
