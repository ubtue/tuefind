<h1>RelBib Open Journals</h1>
<p>
    The Subject Information Service (FID) for the Study of Religion supports and promotes open access journals relevant to the study of religion. With the platform &ldquo;RelBib Open Journals&rdquo; we offer publishers the possibility to host their journals or series permanently open access. Next to the admission of new open access journals, we are also happy to assist you with the transfer of your journal from another platform to open access. We provide you with the publication management software Open Journal Systems (OJS), which can be used to run the entire editorial process right through to publication.
