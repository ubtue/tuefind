Subject: VuFind Online Payments - Manual Processing Required (<?=$errorCount?>)

There are online payments that have been paid by the patrons, but have not been successfully registered in the library management system.

Failed payments need to be processed manually before the patron can pay any further fees online.

Please go to the VuFind Administration to validate these payments.
