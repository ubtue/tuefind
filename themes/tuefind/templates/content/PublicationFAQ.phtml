<h2>Self-Archiving Service FAQ</h2>

<h3>Legal and general issues</h3>
<p>The following information was verified carefully, but it does not constitute binding legal advice. We do not assume any liability for possible errors.</p>


<div class="tf-panel-collapse">
    <p data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#col1" aria-expanded="false" class="tf-panel-collapse-heading"><b>What can I republish?</b></p>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col1">

        <p>Unfortunately, the legal situation with regards to republication is not completely clear. Different national laws may apply depending on the country of the publishing house. Furthermore, many publishing houses describe their policies and rules with regards to republication on their respective websites. You can often find these policies under headings such as “Self-Archiving” or “Open Access”. Such policies may also be found on the platform <a target="_blank" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa Romeo</a>.We would advise you to examine the legal situation carefully and, in case of doubt, to ask permission from the publishing house for a republication. </p>
        <p>For works or articles published by a German publishing house, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/urhg/__38.html">§38</a> of the German copyright law applies. The republication of articles from journals, anthologies and dictionaries or encyclopedias is basically allowed, but it may depend on individual agreements reached with the publisher. Monographs may not be republished unless there is an agreement to this effect (e.g. in the case of a dissertation which is out of print) with the publishing house.</p>

<div class="tf-panel-collapse">
    <p data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#col2" aria-expanded="false" class="tf-panel-collapse-heading"><b>What about contracts with a publishing house and their policies?</b></p>
    <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col2">

        <p>When a text is published for the first time, you often have a contract with the corresponding publishing house in which the right to use this publication is defined. This right determines the extent to which you may republish this work, provided it complies with the legal restrictions in place.</p>
        <p>In order to simplify this process, many publishing houses have adopted policies with specific rules for republication. You can find these policies on their websites under headings such as “Republication”, “Self-Archiving” or “Open Access”. If your publishing house has not made public any policy with regards to republication, you should ask them directly about their policy. Such policies can also be found through the platform <a target="_blank" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa Romeo</a>.</p>

    <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col3">
        <p>When you republish a publication through <?=$currentSystem;?>, it gets stored in a repository managed by the University of Tübingen. The repository for <?=$currentSystem;?> constitutes a non-commercial subject repository. Depending on the policy of the publishing house involved in the first publication, it is possible to republish an article on one’s own personal website, on a repository belonging to one’s own institution or on a non-commercial subject repository. Commercial services such as Academia or ResearchGate are often excluded.</p>
        <p>If you are not allowed to republish your work on a non-commercial subject repository, you may be allowed to republish it in the repository of your own institution. In this case, please consult the person responsible for Open Access publications at your university library. We would appreciate it very much if you could let us know which of your publications were republished in your institutional repository so that we may include a reference to them in <?=$currentSystem;?>.</p>

    <div class="collapse multi-collapse tf-panel-collapse-body" id="col5">
        <p>Yes, we would ask you to provide a cover page with the complete bibliographical information of the first publication of your article. This cover page should at least contain the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A note explaining that this article is being republished under the Green Open Access model</li>
            <li>Title of the article</li>

        <p>The right to use some images does not automatically apply for a republication. You should therefore verify whether you have the right to use these images again in a republication, and if not, acquire them again.</p>

            <li>
                <p>You need a user account in <?=$currentSystem;?>.</p>

            </li>
            <p><b>Requesting Access Rights</b></p>
            <li>
                <p>Once you’ve logged into your <?=$currentSystem;?>-account, you can request access rights to your author ID. First click on the tab labelled “Persons / Corporations“ right above the search field. Search for your name and select the right entry.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                <p>Your file then gets uploaded in our repository. It should be available in Open Access to other users on the following day. At the same time, stable links (handle/DOI) to the file are generated, which you can also access on the following day.

        <p>A persistent identifier or stable link is assigned to every file in order to make your republished article permanently retrievable. This link will never change, even if the file itself is moved to another storage location. This means that references to your publication using this link in our repository will always remain accurate. For this purpose, <?=$currentSystem;?> uses Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and handles (links). Since the DOI first has to be generated, it becomes available only approx. 24 hours after the upload and appears within a few days in <?=$currentSystem;?>. </p>
